.SH NAME

oam expire \- prune old log file sets written by oam

.SH SYNOPSIS

.B
oam expire [-h] [<logdir> <keeplogs> <dryrun>]

.SH DESCRIPTION

.B oam expire
is typically called from cron.

It will tar and compress all but the last N sets of logfiles to the /var/log/oam/old directory.

A set is a directory where the logfiles for one day are written (e.g. /var/log/oam/20150711).

The installation installs a script into /etc/cron.daily.
